# ðŸŽ® Randomized Tic-Tac-Toe Simulator (p5.js)

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built in **2 days** using **JavaScript** and the **p5.js** library.  
The game randomly places Xs and Os turn by turn and checks for a winner or a draw.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… Random turn-based X and O generation
- âœ… Board automatically updates each move
- âœ… Checks for winning conditions (rows, columns, diagonals)
- âœ… Declares a winner or draw once the board is full
- âœ… Simple and clean interface using p5.js

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

This project, though small, taught me a lot about:
- Turn-based logic implementation
- 2D array (grid) manipulation in JavaScript
- Win-condition checking using simple mathematics
- How randomness can make a deterministic game interesting
- Debugging and refining through **trial & error**
